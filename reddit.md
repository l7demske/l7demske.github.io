## Posting Images on Reddit

For this task, you will need an image saved in PNG or JPG format, as well as accounts set up in [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Imgur](https://imgur.com/). You can include up to 20 images per Reddit post.   


1.	Sign in to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/).
2.	Click your username and select **Images** > **Add Images**.
3.	Click **Browse** to find your image. Double click your image to upload it.
4.	Click the thumbnail of your image that is now on your Imgur screen. 
5.	Under **Direct Link**, click **Copy**.
6.	Sign in to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).
7.	Click the **Create Media Post** icon in the **Create Post** screen.
8.	In the **Choose a community** field, select the community to which you want to post. [Note: you can also post to a community or subreddit you have not joined by navigating to that community before completing Step 7.]
9.	On the **Images & Video** tab, select **Upload** and upload your image. A plus sign (+) icon will appear next to the thumbnail of that image. Click this icon to upload additional images from Imgur. You can upload and post up to 20. [Note: If you upload multiple images to post, you need to paste the links you copied from Imgur into the **Add a link...** fields that are diplayed for each image. Optionally, add a caption for each in the **Add a caption...** field. You can only add captions when multiple images are uploaded.]  
10.	If you are posting only a single image, paste the link you copied from Imgur into the **Url** field on the **Link** tab. 
12.	In the **Title** field, specify a title for your post. 
13.	Click **Post**.
14.	Refresh the screen to see your post and add the text of your post as a comment in the **What are your thoughts?** window.
