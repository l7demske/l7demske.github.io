## Posting Images on Reddit

For this task, you will need an image saved in PNG or JPG format, as well as accounts set up in [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Imgur](https://imgur.com/). You can include up to 20 images per Reddit post.   

<ol>
<li>Sign in to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/).</li>
<li>Click your username and select **Images**.</li>  
<li>Click **Add Images**.</li>
<li>Click **Browse** to find your image. Double click your image to upload it.</li>
<li>Click the thumbnail of your image that is now on your Imgur screen.</li> 
<li>Under **Direct Link**, click **Copy**.</li>
<li>Sign in to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/).</li>
<li>Click the **Create Media Post** icon in the **Create Post** screen.</li>
<li>In the **Choose a community** field, select the community to which you want to post.  

    Note: You can also post to a community or subreddit you have not joined by navigating to that community before completing Step 8.</li>
    
<li>On the **Images & Video** tab, select **Upload** and upload your image. If this community allows multiple images, a plus sign (+) icon will appear next to the thumbnail of your image after you upload it. Optionally, click this icon to upload additional images. You can upload and post up to 20.  

    Note: If you upload multiple images, you must paste the links that you copied from Imgur into the **Add a link...** fields that are diplayed for each image.       Optionally, add a caption for each in the **Add a caption...** field. You can only add captions when multiple images are uploaded.</li>  
    
<li>If you are posting only a single image, paste the link you copied from Imgur into the **Url** field on the **Link** tab.</li> 
<li>In the **Title** field, specify a title for your post.</li> 
<li>Click **Post**.</li>
<li>Refresh the screen to see your post and add the text of your post as a comment in the **What are your thoughts?** window.</li>
<li>Click **Comment**.</li>
</ol>
Congrats! You've created and published a Reddit post with illustrative visual aids!
